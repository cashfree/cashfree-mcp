# Cashfree MCP Server

Cashfree MCP server allows AI tools and agents to integrate with [Cashfree](https://www.cashfree.com/) APIs (Payment Gateway, Payouts, and SecureID) using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

## Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-mcp.git
cd cashfree-mcp
```

### Install Dependencies

Before installing, ensure you have **Node.js v14.x or higher** installed. If you're using `nvm` or `brew`, make sure the correct version is active:

```bash
node -v
# Should output v14.x or higher
```

#### Step 1: Install project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages listed in `package.json`.

> üí° If you're using `Node.js >=18`, you might face peer dependency issues with packages like `undici`. In that case, upgrade Node.js to `>=20.18.1` or adjust the package version if needed.

#### Step 2: Build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the source files to the `dist/` directory, which is required to run the MCP server.

> üõ†Ô∏è If you see errors related to missing files in `/dist`, ensure you've run the build step successfully.

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### API Credentials

Set the following environment variables for each service:
**Payment Gateway:**

- `PAYMENTS_APP_ID`: Your Payment Gateway client ID
- `PAYMENTS_APP_SECRET`: Your Payment Gateway client secret

**Payouts:**

- `PAYOUTS_APP_ID`: Your Payouts client ID
- `PAYOUTS_APP_SECRET`: Your Payouts client secret
- `TWO_FA_PUBLIC_KEY_PEM_PATH`: Path to your 2FA public key (required only if 2FA is enabled)

**SecureID:**

- `SECUREID_APP_ID`: Your SecureID client ID
- `SECUREID_APP_SECRET`: Your SecureID client secret
- `TWO_FA_PUBLIC_KEY_PEM_PATH`: Path to your 2FA public key (required only if 2FA is enabled)

### Environment

`ENV`: Set to `production` for production environment, `sandbox` for sandbox (default: `sandbox`)

### Tools Configuration

`TOOLS`: Comma-separated list of modules to enable. Available options:

- `pg`: Payment Gateway APIs
- `payouts`: Payouts APIs
- `secureid`: SecureID APIs

### Elicitation Configuration

`ELICITATION_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable interactive parameter elicitation, `false` to disable (default: `false`)

When enabled, the MCP server will prompt users for missing required parameters instead of failing with validation errors. This provides a more interactive experience by asking users to provide values for required fields that weren't initially supplied.
